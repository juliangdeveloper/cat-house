schema: 1
story: "3.3"
story_title: "Task Command Handlers (Create & List)"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All acceptance criteria met with 100% test coverage (20/20 passing). Excellent implementation following universal handler pattern with comprehensive validation, error handling, and structured logging."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "User scoping enforced on all queries, parameterized SQL prevents injection, generic error messages prevent information leakage, input validation via Pydantic"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Optimal database index usage (composite index for filtered queries), direct asyncpg operations, connection pooling, single-query operations (no N+1)"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling (ValidationError → 400, Database → 500), structured logging for debugging, proper async/await usage, asyncpg Row to dict conversion"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns (validation → SQL → response), comprehensive docstrings, type hints throughout, follows universal handler signature pattern, excellent code comments"

  key_test_scenarios:
    validation:
      - "Missing title returns 400 with Pydantic error details"
      - "Invalid status/priority returns 400 with validation error"
    database_operations:
      - "Create task with RETURNING clause gets all generated fields"
      - "List tasks uses composite index for filtered queries"
      - "asyncpg Row to dict conversion handles all field types"
    error_handling:
      - "Database errors return 500 with generic message"
      - "ValidationError returns 400 with helpful details"
    security:
      - "User scoping prevents cross-user data access"
      - "SQL injection prevented via parameterized queries"
    response_format:
      - "create returns single task dict with all fields"
      - "list returns {tasks: [...], count: N} structure"

architecture_compliance:
  handler_signature: "✅ Follows universal pattern: async def handler(user_id, payload, db) -> dict"
  validation_pattern: "✅ Two-stage: CommandRequest → TaskCreate/TaskUpdate"
  error_handling: "✅ HTTPException with appropriate status codes"
  logging: "✅ Structured with all required context fields"
  database_access: "✅ Direct asyncpg with parameterized queries"
  response_format: "✅ Returns dict (not Pydantic models) for router wrapping"

requirements_traceability:
  AC1_create_module: "✅ Module created with proper structure and docstrings"
  AC2_create_handler: "✅ Implemented with validation, database ops, error handling - 11 tests"
  AC3_list_handler: "✅ Implemented with filtering, user scoping - 9 tests"
  AC4_asyncpg_usage: "✅ Both handlers use asyncpg.fetchrow/fetch correctly"
  AC5_error_handling: "✅ ValidationError → 400, Database → 500, with structured logging"
  AC6_handler_registration: "✅ Both handlers in ACTION_HANDLERS dictionary"
  AC7_dict_responses: "✅ Both return dict (verified in all tests)"

security_validation:
  user_scoping: "✅ All queries filter by user_id parameter"
  sql_injection: "✅ Parameterized queries ($1, $2) throughout"
  input_validation: "✅ Pydantic TaskCreate model validates all inputs"
  error_disclosure: "✅ Generic error messages (500: 'Internal server error')"
  logging_security: "✅ Context for debugging without sensitive data exposure"

performance_validation:
  index_usage: "✅ Composite index (user_id, status) for optimal query performance"
  connection_pooling: "✅ FastAPI dependency injection provides pooled connections"
  query_efficiency: "✅ Single-query operations, no N+1 patterns"
  response_serialization: "✅ Efficient Pydantic model_dump(mode='json')"

documentation:
  code_comments: "✅ Comprehensive docstrings with examples in handlers"
  readme_updates: "✅ Available Actions section with curl examples"
  dev_notes: "✅ Story includes architecture patterns and testing strategy"
