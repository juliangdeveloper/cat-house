nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "X-Service-Key authentication enforced by router, user isolation validated, parameterized queries prevent SQL injection, no sensitive data logging"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exceptional - ~15ms total (10.43ms service layer + 5ms handler overhead) vs 200ms target. 92.5% headroom. Performance test validates AC6 with 1000 tasks."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with HTTPException(500) for unexpected failures, structured logging at all levels, service layer handles database errors"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent - thin handler (43 lines), delegates to service layer, comprehensive docstrings, type hints throughout, follows established patterns from Stories 3.3/3.4"
