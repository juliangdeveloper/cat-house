# Technical details
technical_notes:
  structlog_visibility: "Startup event log may not appear in docker-compose logs due to uvicorn's log buffering. Configuration verified via direct container test showing correct JSON output."
  cors_strategy: "Hardcoded origins appropriate for MVP phase. Migration to environment variables planned for Story 1.5."
  health_endpoint_design: "Simple status check without database connectivity per incremental development approach. Database check will be added in Story 3.1."
