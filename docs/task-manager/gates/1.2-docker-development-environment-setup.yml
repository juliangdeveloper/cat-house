review_notes: |
  Comprehensive infrastructure setup with professional-grade configuration.
  
  Strengths:
  - Complete Docker environment with hot-reload capability
  - Proper port isolation (8888 host, 5435 PostgreSQL to avoid conflicts)
  - Clean separation of production and development dependencies
  - Comprehensive README with troubleshooting and workflow documentation
  - Security best practices (gitignore, env templates)
  - Minimal working FastAPI application (appropriate for verification)
  
  Verification Evidence:
  - Developer manually verified all 10 acceptance criteria
  - Hot-reload functionality tested and confirmed working
  - Database connectivity verified via psql in container
  - API accessibility confirmed at http://localhost:8888
  - Swagger UI accessible at /docs
  
  Technical Implementation:
  - Python 3.12-slim base image with gcc and PostgreSQL client libraries
  - asyncpg + PostgreSQL 16 Alpine stack configured correctly
  - Volume mounts enable instant code reflection in container
  - Environment configuration follows 12-factor app principles
  
  No refactoring required - implementation is production-ready.
