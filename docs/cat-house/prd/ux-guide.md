# Cat House - UX Guide (for AI Agents)

**Created:** January 5, 2026  
**Document Type:** UX Guidance (Agent-Oriented)

---

## Purpose

Provide a compact, actionable UX north-star for agents of IA that generate UI flows, copy, and interaction patterns for Cat House.

---

## UX North Star

- **Cozy + calm:** minimal cognitive load, friendly tone, soft visuals.
- **One primary action per screen:** obvious CTA, large touch targets.
- **Cards over chrome:** content lives in cards; navigation stays simple.

---

## Visual Language

- Prefer warm/pastel palettes, soft contrast, whitespace, rounded corners.
- Keep a consistent cat/mascot presence (small sticker/character) that supports, not distracts.
- Use illustration-like backgrounds for “focus / bonding” moments; keep utility surfaces neutral.

---

## Layout Patterns

- Favor simple vertical stacks; avoid dense grids.
- Use a clear structure: **header → primary card(s) → bottom actions**.
- Keep controls discoverable and separated from content (don’t hide key actions behind multiple taps).

---

## Interaction Patterns

- **Primary CTA:** one clear action (e.g., floating “+”, Adopt/Install), always reachable.
- **Secondary actions:** icons/overflow, never competing with primary.
- **Small scope switching:** segmented controls (e.g., Today/All) instead of deep navigation.
- **State-as-hero:** for focus/timer flows, the state is the main content (big timer, single start/stop).

---

## Copy & Feedback

- Short, friendly, concrete microcopy; avoid jargon.
- Prefer optimistic defaults and reversible actions.
- Feedback should be lightweight: subtle toasts, badges, small helper text (avoid modal alerts by default).

## Cat Interaction Screen (Dating-Sim Style)

A dedicated “bonding” screen inspired by Japanese dating sims:

- **Background character:** the cat/mascot is the visual anchor (idle/looped pose) in the background.
- **Interaction cards:** user choices and system responses appear as stacked cards in the foreground.
- **Turn-based feel:** one prompt at a time; each card resolves into an outcome card (reward, mood change, item, cooldown).
- **Primary action area:** a single obvious next action (e.g., “Pet”, “Talk”, “Feed”) shown as one CTA or a small set of 2–3 cards.
- **Progress cues:** simple, non-intrusive indicators (mood icon, bond meter) near the top—never blocking the character.

Agent rule: keep the screen readable even if the background is busy—foreground cards must remain the highest-contrast surface.
